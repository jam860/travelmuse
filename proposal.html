        <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
        <p>The problem at hand is the inefficiency and complexity associated with collaborative travel itinerary planning. When groups of travelers plan trips together, they often face challenges in coordinating their preferences, sharing information, and keeping their itineraries up-to-date. We want to address this problem by creating a web application that facilitates collaborative travel itinerary planning. This application would allow users to create an account, build personalized travel itineraries, and share these itineraries with friends or fellow travelers. Additionally, users should be able to search within the itinerary for specific details or attractions. One of the key information technology problems in this space is the efficient management of collaborative travel itineraries. Creating a platform where users can easily collaborate on planning, update itineraries in real-time, and access relevant information is a complex challenge. Several existing travel planning web applications and platforms attempt to address the collaborative travel itinerary problem to varying degrees. Examples include platforms like <a href="https://www.tripit.com/web">TripIt</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/travel/">Google Trips</a>, and various travel-focused social networks. These solutions offer features for itinerary creation and sharing, but they may not fully address real-time collaboration and efficient searching within itineraries. They often rely on manual data input and lack the seamless integration of data sources.</p>
