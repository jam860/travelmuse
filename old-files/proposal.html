        <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
        <p>The problem at hand is the inefficiency and complexity associated with collaborative travel itinerary planning. When groups of travelers plan trips together, they often face challenges in coordinating their preferences, sharing information, and keeping their itineraries up-to-date. We want to address this problem by creating a web application that facilitates collaborative travel itinerary planning. This application would allow users to create an account, build personalized travel itineraries, and share these itineraries with friends or fellow travelers. Additionally, users should be able to search within the itinerary for specific details or attractions. One of the key information technology problems in this space is the efficient management of collaborative travel itineraries. Creating a platform where users can easily collaborate on planning, update itineraries in real-time, and access relevant information is a complex challenge. Several existing travel planning web applications and platforms attempt to address the collaborative travel itinerary problem to varying degrees. Examples include platforms like <a href="https://www.tripit.com/web">TripIt</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/travel/">Google Trips</a>, and various travel-focused social networks. These solutions offer features for itinerary creation and sharing, but they may not fully address real-time collaboration and efficient searching within itineraries. They often rely on manual data input and lack the seamless integration of data sources.</p>

        <h2>App Description</h2>
        <p>Our target users of this application are young adults who are traveling alone or in a group, travel enthusiasts, and leisure travelers. With accessibility to users from around the world, our application is thoughtfully designed to be not only user-friendly but also culturally sensitive, ensuring a warm and inclusive experience for travelers of diverse backgrounds and origins.
        </p>
        <p>In this website application, users will be able to log-in and save their itineraries, manually input events into their itineraries (flights, events, rental cars), and search within their itinerary. Clients may create as many itineraries as they like, and save it onto their account. If logged in, the home screen would include perhaps some of their saved itineraries, but there would be a separate tab/section with all the itineraries. When inputting events for the itineraries, they can input information such as the day/time, description, a picture and more. When creating a new itinerary, there would be a “create new event” button where clients can fill out a form-like tab with the details, and that event will be added onto the itinerary (changing the document object model as they add items). Each individual itinerary will have a search where clients can search for an item by the event's name.
        </p>
        <p>Users will be able to view information that can help them plan and navigate their trips effectively. This includes destination details, transportation, activities and attractions, restaurants and dining, and personal notes and reminders. We will also attempt to implement a feature that can autocomplete addresses when the users are typing an address string by using the <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/place-autocomplete">Maps API</a>.
        </p>

        <p>Using our application will significantly alleviate inefficiencies and complexities in collaborative trip planning among friends and families. This app addresses the problem by:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <em>Efficient Collaboration:</em> By having users create accounts and collaborate on travel itineraries together, friends and families can easily work together on planning their trips, share their preferences, and make real-time updates to the itinerary. This can address the issue of disorganized planning that often occurs when multiple individuals are involved.
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>Comprehensive Itinerary Management:</em> Users can keep track of everyone's flights, Airbnb/hotel reservations, and rental cars within the app. This centralized platform ensures that all travel-related information is readily accessible and up-to-date for all trip participants.
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>Efficient Searching:</em> The search functionality within each itinerary enables users to quickly locate specific details or attractions, eliminating the need to sift through lengthy itineraries manually.

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>With these implemented features, our app simplifies the collaborative travel planning process, and reduces the chances of miscommunication while keeping all its users updated on the latest changes. This can solve practical problems faced by travelers, and by designing the app with inclusivity and accessibility in mind, we aim to ensure that travelers from diverse backgrounds can benefit equally from its features.
